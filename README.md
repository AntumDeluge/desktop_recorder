## Desktop recording frontend for FFmpeg

* Quality is actually video bitrate. If you want 1.4Mbps then set quality to: 1400000
    Leave quality at -1 for default (same as "-sameq" in ffmpeg)
* The "Pause" option does not work yet.
* If the program doesn't shutdown properly you will have to delete "~/.config/desktop_recorder/lock"

### Project status: Unstable
